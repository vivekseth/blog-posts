# What is the difference between a theorem, a lemma, and a corollary?

This morning I was reading this paper: ["Verifying Strong Eventual Consistency in Distributed Systems"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01747.pdf) and realized that I didn't actually know what a "lemma" or "corollary" was 😅.

Today I decided to look up the definitions for these terms and came across [this blog post by  Professor David Richeson](https://divisbyzero.com/2008/09/22/what-is-the-difference-between-a-theorem-a-lemma-and-a-corollary/). In his post he defines "theorem", "lemma", "corollary", and a few other related terms.
